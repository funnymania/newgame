# My Game Dev Land
All active development on games can be found in the branches. Main will not be updated, likely at any point in the future, excepting this README.

I will only be treating main as the 'Start' from which to branch off new ideas from. Note this may never happen either, I may just create a new repo if I find 'main' to be hosed.

If at all interested in this project, please reach out via the socials in my profile.

Much of this was inspired by Casey Muratori's Handheld Hero series, which I highly recommend to any one who wants to make something awesome.
